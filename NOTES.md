# Calibre + DeDRM + ADE in Docker — Implementation Notes

Reproducible Docker setup that decrypts Adobe ADEPT-DRM'd ePubs (Kobo, library loans, Google Play, etc.) via Calibre's DeDRM plugin, with Adobe Digital Editions running under Wine inside the container. Authorized once, persisted via host volumes, reused indefinitely.

**Status: complete and working as of 2026-05-19.**

## Why this setup

- Native Wine setup is fragile and pollutes the host. Container isolates it.
- Authorization is interactive (Adobe ID login in ADE's GUI), so the image cannot be fully pre-baked. First run uses X11 forwarding to authorize; afterwards the prefix lives in a host volume and the container is headless.
- ADE installer cannot be redistributed (Adobe license), so it must be supplied locally — added to the build context, not downloaded at build time.
- This is Adobe ADEPT only. Kindle DRM is a different pipeline (Kindle for PC, different keys).

## Working pipeline

**Full automated pipeline (one command):**

Drop the `.acsm` file into `./volumes/ade-books/`, then:

```bash
docker compose run --rm calibre dedrm /home/calibre/ade-books-input/book.acsm
```

ADE opens in the background, downloads the epub, DeDRM decrypts it. Output lands in `./volumes/books/`.

**Manual fallback:**

1. `xhost +local:docker && docker compose run --rm calibre ade` — open ADE, redeem the file; epub lands inside the wineprefix at `My Digital Editions/` (symlinked to `/home/calibre/ade-books` inside the container)
2. `docker compose run --rm calibre decrypt /home/calibre/ade-books/book.epub` — headless CLI decrypt; output goes to `./volumes/books/`

## Volume layout

```
volumes/
├── wineprefix/       # ADE authorization + Python — do not wipe without erasing ADE auth first
├── calibre-config/   # Calibre library and plugin config
├── books/            # CLI decrypt output
├── ade-books/        # ADE My Digital Editions — books downloaded via ASCM land here
└── winetricks-cache/ # speeds up rebuilds that need winetricks
```

## What actually worked vs the original plan

| Topic | Original plan | What was needed |
|---|---|---|
| Base image | ubuntu:24.04 | ubuntu:24.04 ✓ |
| Windows version | win7 | **win10** — Python 3.12 requires Win8+; win7 silently fails the installer |
| winetricks components | dotnet40 corefonts tahoma windowscodecs | **dotnet48, no windowscodecs** — dotnet40 fails on Wine 9.x with `BindImageEx` errors; dotnet48 is cumulative and reliable. windowscodecs conflicts with Wine 9's built-in WIC. |
| Python PATH | `PrependPath=1` during installer | **manual `wine reg add HKCU\Environment` + HKLM system PATH** — PrependPath silently fails under Wine |
| Python exe path | drive_c/Python312/python.exe | `drive_c/users/calibre/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312-32/python.exe` |
| DeDRM config file | calibre/plugins/DeDRM.json | **plugins/dedrm.json** (lowercase, one level up) |
| DeDRM WinePythonCLI | finds python.exe by PATH | **must patch wineutils.py** — Wine uses ShellExecute for name-based lookup, which fails for console apps; full path forces CreateProcess |
| Wine Gecko | assumed present | must pre-fetch `wine_gecko-2.47.4-x86.msi`; CDN unreliable at build time so wrapped in `|| true` |
| UID pinning | create calibre at 1000 | Ubuntu 24.04 pre-creates `ubuntu` at UID 1000 — must `userdel` it first |
| X11 / MIT-SHM crash | not anticipated | `ipc: host` in docker-compose + `libgl1:i386` in image |
| ADE books volume | nested mount inside wineprefix | **do not mount inside wineprefix** — overlays hide ADE library files and corrupts state. Symlink `/home/calibre/ade-books` → wineprefix in entrypoint; separate `ade-books-input` mount for ACSM input files |
| Volume ownership | Docker auto-creates dirs as root | must `mkdir -p volumes/*` on host before first run; Docker-created dirs are owned by root and container user can't write |

## Gotchas

- **Wine prefix must stay win32.** `WINEARCH=win32` everywhere. `syswow64\ntdll.dll error c0000135` = prefix went 64-bit — erase ADE auth first (`Help → Erase Authorization`), then delete `volumes/wineprefix/`.
- **Python must be 32-bit.** Installer without `-amd64` in the filename. DeDRM's `WinePythonCLI` looks for `python.exe` by name; the Windows PATH registry entry must exist.
- **`corefonts` + `tahoma` are mandatory.** ADE crashes in `FontFamily.get_FirstFontFamily()` without them.
- **win10 mode required.** ADE needs Win7+, Python 3.12 needs Win8+. win10 satisfies both.
- **`windowscodecs` must be omitted.** Wine 9 ships its own WIC; the native override breaks the prefix.
- **ADE 4.5 vs 4.0.3.** If 4.5 refuses to authorize under Wine 9.x, rebuild with `ADE_4.0.3_Installer.exe`. The plugin doesn't care which version produced the key.
- **Adobe authorization limit.** ~6 devices per Adobe ID. Use `Help → Erase Authorization` in ADE before wiping `volumes/wineprefix/`.
- **`ntlm_auth not found` warnings are noise** — silenced by the `winbind` package.
- **First Calibre import failure after setup** usually means `adobewineprefix` in `plugins/dedrm.json` is wrong. Must be the container path `/home/calibre/wineprefix`.
- **`dotnet40` fails on Wine 9.x** with `BindImageEx Import ... was not found` errors. Use `dotnet48` instead — it's cumulative and installs cleanly.
- **Volume dir ownership**: if Docker creates `volumes/wineprefix/` automatically, it's owned by root. The container's `calibre` user (UID 1000) can't write to it. Always `mkdir -p volumes/*` on the host before first `docker compose run`.
- **DeDRM `wine python.exe` returns "not python3"**: Wine uses ShellExecute for name-based executable lookup, which fails for console apps. The entrypoint patches `wineutils.py` in the DeDRM plugin zip to use the full path (`C:\users\calibre\...\python.exe`), which forces CreateProcess and works correctly.
- **Do not mount `ade-books` inside the wineprefix path**: a Docker bind mount inside another bind mount hides the existing directory contents, breaking ADE's library state. The `ade-books-input` volume is mounted separately at `/home/calibre/ade-books-input` for dropping in ACSM input files.

## Headless authorization

Three strategies, in order of reliability:

### Strategy 1 — Snapshot restore (`WINEPREFIX_SNAPSHOT`)

Authorize once interactively, then tar the result:

```bash
docker compose down
tar -czf wineprefix-authorized.tar.gz -C volumes wineprefix/
```

On any new host (including Home Assistant), set the env var and run normally:

```bash
WINEPREFIX_SNAPSHOT=/path/to/wineprefix-authorized.tar.gz docker compose run --rm calibre dedrm ...
# or via .env / docker-compose.yml environment section
# also accepts https:// URLs
```

The tarball is extracted on the first run when `$WINEPREFIX/.winetricks_done` is absent. All subsequent runs skip the restore. **Treat as secret** — it contains the device key tied to your Adobe ID.

### Strategy 2 — Headless credentials (`ADOBE_EMAIL` + `ADOBE_PASSWORD`)

Set in `.env` or HA secrets store:

```ini
ADOBE_EMAIL=you@example.com
ADOBE_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

The entrypoint installs ADE silently (`/S` NSIS flag), starts it under Xvfb, and automates the **Help → Authorize Computer** dialog via xdotool (`alt+h → a → Tab/type/Return`). Polls the Wine registry for the ADEPT activation key for up to 60 s.

**Caveat:** depends on ADE 4.0.3's menu layout. If the key sequence doesn't land on "Authorize Computer...", the automation silently fails and logs a warning — fall back to Option B or snapshot.

### Authorization check

`ade_is_authorized()` greps `$WINEPREFIX/user.reg` for the `Adept\Activation` registry key. Runs on every startup; skips all auth logic if already authorized.

### ADE install is now silent

`wine "$ADE_INSTALLER" /S` — NSIS silent flag, no GUI click-through needed. ADE installs to its default path under the Wine prefix. A `sleep 10` follows to let the installer finish before checking for the executable.
